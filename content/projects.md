# Projects

_A comprehensive index of all projects I have built or contributed to._

_**Note:** The list is not really manually updated (much), and would be quite outdated._

Most descriptions have been directly taken from the respective repositories' descriptions on GitHub, so they might not all be up to the mark. Projects listed with a reduced opacity indicates that it is unmaintained, abandoned or archived.

You can also view the [main index repository and data file](https://github.com/plibither8/index) to view the automation scripts.
