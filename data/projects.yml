  caption: 'Browser extension: Hacker News, but refined — Interface tweaks and features
    to make the HN experience better'
  details:
  - This browser extension adds much-needed features, and tweaks a few stuff on Hacker
    News to make the browsing experience better... without changing the look and feel.
    The minimalist and raw design of the site is sacrosanct and should remain intact!

  caption: The official website of Sanskriti School, New Delhi
  details:
  - In late 2017 I was tasked with making my school a new website, solo. It was the
    first time I was handling a project of such scale &ndash; the development of which
    featured extensive cross-browser and cross-device testing, multiple revisions
    and beta-testers to ensure a uniform and accessible experience to all thirty-thousand
    of its monthly visitors.
  - All in all, the entire project took almost a year to finish, primarily due to
    my engagements with grade 12 studies and competitive examination preparations.
    The website was finally pushed to production in July of 2018.

  details:
  - Inspired by the <a href='https://madewithlove.org.in' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Made
    With Love in India Campaign</a>, and driven by the urge to publish something on
    ZEIT's Now platform to understand what <em>serverless deployments</em> were all
    about, I created a microservice to serve SVG "Made with ♥️ in &lt;country-name&gt;"
    badges for developers to show off their and their project's country of origin.
